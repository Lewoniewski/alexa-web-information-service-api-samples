Alexa's Web Services can help you create innovative web solutions and services based on Alexa's vast repository of information about the web. Developers, researchers, web site owners, and merchants can incorporate information about web sites directly into their own web sites or services. Users can access web site traffic data, related links, and a wide variety of other functionality and data.

#### URL Information
The URL Information action gives developers direct access to information pertaining to web pages and sites on the web that Alexa Internet has gathered through its extensive web crawl and web usage analysis. Examples of information that can be accessed are site popularity and detailed usage/traffic stats.
